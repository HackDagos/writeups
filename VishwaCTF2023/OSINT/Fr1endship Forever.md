## Description

This is going to be a double hunt...

My childhood Fr1end James has posted something about the project he made on his socials (just to flaunt). Today is our submission day and my Fr1end James is absent. Yesterday when we met him, he told me, "Mark can you submit my project also with yours, as I will be going out of the city tomorrow morning." He forgot to tell me anything about his project. He is not even picking up my phone.

Help me find him and of course his project.

## **Solution**

I found out about "Fr1end James" Twitter account https://twitter.com/Fr1endJames and looked at his 30 March tweet: "Our Endsem_Last_Minute-Project is getting recognization. 
Happy to hear that !!!ðŸ—¿"

So I checked on GitHub and i found this public project: https://github.com/Your-James/Endsem_Last_Minute-Project

Here I was able to get the flag: **VishwaCTF{LbjtQY_449yfcD}**
