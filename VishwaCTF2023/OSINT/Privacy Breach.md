## Description

Dude...They just emailed my own password back to me (and it wasn't even asterisked) Don't they know that's a severe breach of privacy!!! Offenders leaked them in PlainText. I hope they lie at the bottom of the deepest pits of hell Can you tell me their domain name??


## **Solution**

This challenge was a bit tricky because it was hard to find the right domain.

I found a list of "sex offender" in **Tumblr** https://plaintextoffenders.com/offenders

i got this GitHub link: https://github.com/plaintextoffenders/plaintextoffenders/blob/master/offenders.csv

The flag was the last one from the list VishwaCTF: napcosecurity.com

flag --> **VishwaCTF{napcosecurity.com}**
